# tsql2sday

[T-SQL Tuesday](http://tsqltuesday.com/) is a monthly event (held on the second Tuesday) [created by Adam Machanic](http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/archive/2009/11/30/invitation-to-participate-in-t-sql-tuesday-001-date-time-tricks.aspx) where a host invites bloggers in the SQL Server community to write articles on a theme the host selects.

[A human-readable format of history of events])http://tsqltuesday.com/) is curated by Steve Jones.

This project provides a framework for a structured format of that same historical data.

Ideally, the structured data could be displayed cleanly for humans.

A proof of concept for that visual display is [hosted here](https://rileymajor.github.io/tsql2sday/) via [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
